# __Introduction__
A solution stack, also known as a software stack, is a group of software components that work together to provide a comprehensive solution for a specific task or application. It includes the operating system, a web server, a database server, and the programming languages, frameworks, and other software tools required for developing and deploying web applications or other software solutions.
A typical web solution stack might consist of an operating system such as Linux, a web server such as Apache or Nginx, a database server such as MySQL or PostgreSQL, and programming languages such as PHP, Python, or Ruby on Rails. Depending on the application's needs, other software components such as caching tools, load balancers, or monitoring tools may be included in the stack.
There are many different types of solution stacks, each of which is designed to meet specific needs and requirements. Here are a few examples:

1. The LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP): is a well-known solution stack for developing web applications. The Linux operating system, the Apache web server, the MySQL database server, and the PHP programming language are all included. This open-source stack is widely used for developing dynamic websites.
1. LEMP Stack (Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP/Python/Perl): LEMP stack is a variation of the LAMP stack that is used for building web applications. Instead of using the Apache web server that is used in LAMP stack, LEMP stack uses the Nginx web server. The name LEMP stands for Linux, Nginx, MySQL, and PHP/Python/Perl. LEMP stack is commonly used for building web applications that require high performance and scalability, such as e-commerce websites, social networking sites, and content management systems.
1. MEAN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, AngularJS, Node.js): This is another popular solution stack for building web applications is the MEAN stack. It includes the NoSQL database MongoDB, the web framework Express.js, the front-end framework AngularJS, and the Node.js runtime environment. This stack is frequently used to create real-time, single-page web applications.
1. The MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) is a variant of the MEAN stack that employs the React front-end framework rather than AngularJS. Because of the popularity of React and its ease of use, this stack is becoming increasingly popular.
1. Some other commonly used stacks include Java Stack, .NET stack, WAMP stack.

This project focus on LAMP stack so I aim to explain how it works, its advantages and disadvantages.

__This article is sub divided into two sections: section 1 gives a theoritical explanation of LAMP stack while section 2 details how you can successfully deploy a LAMP stack on the AWS cloud__

# __SECTION 1: What is LAMP Stack?__
LAMP stack is a popular open-source software stack used for building web applications. The name LAMP stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL, and PHP. These four components work together to provide a complete solution for building dynamic web applications.
The LAMP stack is used to create a wide range of web applications, such as e-commerce websites, content management systems, and social networking websites. The stack is popular among both developers and system administrators due to its flexibility and ease of use.
One advantage of using the LAMP stack is that it is open source, which means that the individual components can be freely downloaded, used, and modified. This gives developers the freedom to tailor the stack to the specific requirements of their applications.
The LAMP stack is also well-known for its dependability, scalability, and security. Because the individual components are well-established and widely used, there is a large community of developers and system administrators familiar with the stack who can provide support and assistance.

### __LAMP Stack Architecture__
The components of the LAMP stack are:
1. Linux: The operating system used in the stack, which is typically a Linux distribution such as Ubuntu, Debian, or CentOS. Linux has been a free and open-source operating system since the mid-1990s. It now has a large global user base spanning several industries. Linux is popular because it offers more configuration and flexibility than other operating systems.
1. Apache: The Apache web server is used to serve web pages and handle HTTP requests. Apache is one of the most popular web servers in use today, and is known for its stability, flexibility, and security.
1. MySQL: The MySQL relational database management system is used to store and manage data for web applications. MySQL is one of the most widely used database systems and is known for its performance, scalability, and reliability.
1. PHP: The PHP scripting language is used to develop the application logic. PHP is a popular language for building web applications because of its ease of use, flexibility, and compatibility with other technologies.

Each component represents an essential layer of the stack. Together, the components are used to create database-driven, dynamic websites.

__The illustration below shows how the layers stack together:__

At a very high level, the process begins with the Apache web server receiving webpage requests from userâ€™s browser. If the request is for a PHP file, Apache passes the request to PHP, which loads the file and executes the code contained in the file. PHP also communicates with the MySQL database layer to fetch any data referenced in the code. PHP then uses the code in the file and the data from the database to create the HTML that the browser requires to display webpages. After running the code, PHP then passes the resulting data back to the Apache web server to send to the browser and store any new data in the MySQL database. The Linux operating system helps enable these operations.

### __Advantages of using LAMP Stack__
1. Open-source: The LAMP stack's components are all open-source, which means they can be freely downloaded, used, and modified. This makes it simple for developers to begin developing web applications without incurring high costs.
1. The LAMP stack is widely used, so there is a large community of developers and system administrators who are familiar with it and can offer support and assistance.
1. Flexibility: Because the LAMP stack is highly adaptable, developers can tailor it to meet the specific requirements of their applications. Because the stack is open-source, developers can add or remove components as needed.
1. Stability: The LAMP stack's individual components are well-established and widely used, which means they are stable and reliable.
1. Scalability: Because the LAMP stack is highly scalable, it can support a large number of users and a high volume of traffic. This makes it ideal for developing web applications that will grow and expand over time.
1. Security: The LAMP stack is well-known for its security, and there are numerous tools and techniques for securing web applications built with it.
1. Compatibility: Because the LAMP stack is highly compatible with other technologies, it can be used with a wide range of tools and platforms.

### __Disadvantages of using LAMP Stack__
1. Security: While the LAMP stack is generally thought to be secure, it can be vulnerable to security threats if not properly configured or maintained. Developers must be aware of potential security risks and take preventative measures.
1. Lack of Standardization: While the LAMP stack is widely used, there is no standardised set of tools or practises for using it. This can result in inconsistencies and disparities in how the stack is used across development teams.
1. Performance: The size and complexity of the application being built can have an impact on the performance of the LAMP stack. The stack may not be able to provide the required performance for very large or complex applications.
1. Complexity: The LAMP stack can be difficult to set up and configure, especially for new developers. This can result in a steep learning curve and additional time and resources.
1. Limited Windows support: LAMP stack is typically used on Linux-based operating systems, and while it can be used on Windows, it is not as well-supported.
1. Resources Usage: LAMP stack can consume a significant amount of system resources, especially if the application being developed is large or complex. This can make running on low-powered hardware or in resource-constrained environments difficult.

# SECTION 2: PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION 
The first step in this practical guide on how to deploy a LAMP stack on the AWS cloud is to create an AWS free tier account, enable MFA on the root user, modify account level setting to enable IAM users to view billing dashboard, create an admin user group with full access to all AWS services, create an admin user, login with this admin user and launch an ubuntu EC2 instance on the AWS cloud so serve as the linux machine to host our stack.
