# __Deploying a LEMP Stack on AWS__
## __INTRODUCTION__

__What is a LEMP Stack__
LEMP stack is a variation of the LAMP stack that is used for building web applications. Instead of using the Apache web server that is used in LAMP stack, LEMP stack uses the Nginx web server. The name LEMP stands for Linux, Nginx, MySQL, and PHP/Python/Perl. LEMP stack is commonly used for building web applications that require high performance and scalability, such as e-commerce websites, social networking sites, and content management systems.

For a detailed overview of what a technology stack is and the different stacks available, read my previous post on [Deploying a LAMP Stack on AWS](https://medium.com/@angalabiridortimiariyemaxwell/deploying-a-lamp-stack-on-aws-baa300230630 "Deploying a LAMP stack on AWS") 

This post focuses on providing a step-by-step guide on how to successfully deploy a LEMP stack on AWS.

__Objectives__

The objectives of this project include the following:

* To gain a hands-on experience in Linux server administration
* Setting up a robust and scalable web server infrastructure
* Use Nginx to improve the performance and speed of the website.
* Enhancing the security of a website.

__Prerequisites__
* Basic Linux command line knowledge
* Access to a terminal
* Basic knowledge of Vim editor
* Create an AWS Free Tier account (See my previous post on how to get started on AWS)
* Basic SSH knowledge
* Set up AWS CLI
* Knowledge of how to launch an EC2 instance on AWS and connect to this instance (See Step 1 of my previous post on [Deploying a LAMP Stack on AWS](https://medium.com/@angalabiridortimiariyemaxwell/deploying-a-lamp-stack-on-aws-baa300230630 "Deploying a LAMP stack on AWS") for a detailed guide on how to launch an Ubuntu EC2 instance)
